Spotwify: web application

EP
    Spotwify is an entertainment application, utilising Spotify and Twitter API's, to give the user a unique listening experience where they can hear their favorite tracks, get up to date artist information, news - and even mentions direct from Twitter. 

Concept and user story
    Spotwify is an entertainment app which gives the user a novel way to experience their favorite artists. The dev team wanted to try to recreate one of our most used apps (Spotify) and design a new web player interface, giving users a new option to go to, for their entertainment experiences.
